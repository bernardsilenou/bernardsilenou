## 🛠️ Major Project Contributions
### 🏥 [SORMAS-Project](https://github.com/SORMAS-Foundation/SORMAS-Project) 
**Technical Contributor | Issue Development & QA**

I played a key role in the software quality and requirements engineering of the SORMAS ecosystem, bridging the gap between functional needs and technical implementation.

* **Issue Development:** Drafted detailed technical specifications and bug reports to guide development sprints.
* **Quality Assurance (QA):** Identified edge cases and validated fixes to ensure platform stability for global outbreak management.
* **Project Tracking:** Monitored and managed the lifecycle of over **500+ technical interactions** across 20+ pages of history.
* 🔍 **[Archive of my reported issues](https://github.com/SORMAS-Foundation/SORMAS-Project/issues?q=author:bernardsilenou)**

### 📊 [SORMAS-Stats-next-gen](https://github.com/hzi-braunschweig/SORMAS-Stats-next-gen)
**Inventor & Lead Developer**

I conceived and developed the **SORMAS-Stats** ecosystem to provide advanced statistical capabilities for the core platform. As the primary architect, I led the end-to-end development lifecycle:

* **System Invention:** Conceptualised the framework to bridge epidemiological data with real-time statistical analysis.
* **Core Engineering:** Authored the primary source code and algorithms for automated reporting and data visualisation.
* **Database Integration:** Designed and implemented seamless integration layers with the **SORMAS PostgreSQL database**.
* **DevOps:** Architected the **Docker application** and containerization strategy for scalable deployment.

### 🧬 [EpiDataGen](https://github.com/SORMAS-Foundation/EpiDataGen)
**Technical Contributor | Synthetic Data Generation**

I contributed to the development of **EpiDataGen**, a specialised tool used to generate realistic, synthetic epidemiological datasets. This project is critical for testing public health software and training machine learning models without compromising patient privacy.

* **Simulation Logic:** Contributed to the design of algorithms that simulate disease spread and patient trajectories.
* **Research Readiness:** Focused on ensuring generated data maintains the statistical properties of real-world outbreaks for valid research and system benchmarking.
* **Privacy Compliance:** Supported the mission of creating high-utility data that adheres to strict data protection standards (GDPR) by avoiding the use of real PII.
